Description: Stochastic diffusion models are used in cognitive science to analyse response time data 
    from binary decision tasks. They assume that the information supporting one and refuting the other
    decision can be described by an unobservable Wiener process with constant drift over time. Response times
    are generated when this process crosses one out of two boundaries.
    FastRdm provides an R interface to the fast-dm library developed by Voss and Voss (XXXX). Accordingly, 
    the package efficiently estimates the parameters of such diffusion models based on a fast numerical approach
    for solving their defining partial differential equation. In addition to fast-dm, however, the package
    takes advantage of R's formula interface, data handling, parallelization, and visualization capabilities.
